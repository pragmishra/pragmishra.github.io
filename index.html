		<h2> Prag Mishra</h2>
		Carnegie Mellon University | Xerox PARC | Microsoft | Amazon
		<br><br><br>
		As a generalist engineer and scientist, I thrive on bringing innovative ideas to 
		life and crafting disruptive products from the ground up. My passion lies in pioneering 
		research and leading cutting-edge engineering projects in diverse fields such as robotics, 
		artificial intelligence, industrial automation, machine learning, behavioral science, 
		computer vision, geospatial systems and mapping, and autonomous systems. 
		<br><br>
		I hold a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics 
		from <a href="http://cs.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, 
		where I had the privilege of working alongside the 
		renowned  <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/takeo-kanade/">Prof. Takeo Kanade</a> 
		and <a href = "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~amidi/">Dr. Omead Amidi</a> 
		at the <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/">The Robotics Institute</a>.
		Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate degree in 
		<a href="http://www.ecdept.iitkgp.ac.in/">Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering</a> 
		at the prestigious <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur</a>, India.
		<br><br>
		I believe that the technology we create, the intelligent machines we build 
		are integral to our humanity. We build them to augment our human capabilities 
		and to gain a deeper understanding of who we are and what we aspire to be. 
		It fills me with immense enthusiasm to be able to contribute towards 
		shaping the impact of these machines on who we are today and what we will be tomorrow.
